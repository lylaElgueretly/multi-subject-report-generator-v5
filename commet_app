# 📝 Variant Files Implementation Guide

## ✅ Step 1: What You Need to Create

For each statement file you want variants for, create 2 new files:

### Example for Year 7 English:
- `statements_year7_English.py` (already exists - keep as is)
- `statements_year7_English_variant1.py` (NEW - copy structure, change wording)
- `statements_year7_English_variant2.py` (NEW - copy structure, change wording)

## 📋 Step 2: File Structure (Must Be IDENTICAL)

Each variant file MUST have the EXACT same structure as the original:

```python
# statements_year7_English_variant1.py

opening_phrases = [
    "Throughout this term,",  # DIFFERENT WORDING
    "During lessons this term,",  # DIFFERENT WORDING
    # ... more phrases
]

attitude_bank = {
    90: "demonstrated exceptional independence and curiosity in learning",  # DIFFERENT
    85: "showed highly engaged and motivated approach to lessons",  # DIFFERENT
    80: "participated actively and approached tasks with confidence",  # DIFFERENT
    # ... same structure, different wording
}

reading_bank = {
    90: "comprehended texts deeply and drew insightful conclusions",  # DIFFERENT
    # ... etc
}

writing_bank = {
    # ... same bands, different descriptions
}

reading_target_bank = {
    # ... same bands, different targets
}

writing_target_bank = {
    # ... same bands, different targets  
}

closer_bank = [
    "Overall, steady development was evident throughout the term",  # DIFFERENT
    # ... more closers
]
```

## 🎯 Step 3: Which Files to Create Variants For

**Priority 1 (Most Used):**
- `statements_year7_English_variant1.py`
- `statements_year7_English_variant2.py`
- `statements_year8_English_variant1.py`
- `statements_year8_English_variant2.py`

**Priority 2 (If time):**
- `statements_year7_science_variant1.py`
- `statements_year7_science_variant2.py`
- `statements_year8_science_variant1.py`
- `statements_year8_science_variant2.py`

**Priority 3 (Optional):**
- Year 5 variants
- Maths variants

## ⚙️ Step 4: How the App Will Use Them

When you click "🔄 Generate Variant":
1. App checks if variant files exist
2. Randomly picks variant 1 or 2 (or original if no variants)
3. Generates completely different comment with same bands

## ✅ Step 5: Testing

After creating variant files:
1. Upload them to your project
2. Restart the app
3. Generate a comment
4. Click "Generate Variant" - should see different wording!
5. If no variants found, button will show: "No variant files found"

## 🚨 IMPORTANT Rules

1. **Same structure** - All dictionaries must have same keys (90, 85, 80, etc.)
2. **Same file naming** - Exact pattern: `original_name_variant1.py`
3. **Different wording** - Change the text, not the structure
4. **Keep it professional** - Maintain curriculum-aligned language

## 💡 Pro Tip

Use AI to help create variants:
- Give it your original file
- Ask: "Create variant1 with different professional wording, same structure, same bands"
- Review for quality and curriculum alignment
- Repeat for variant2

## Example Prompt for AI:

```
Create a variant of this statement file. Keep the EXACT same structure 
(same dictionary keys: 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 40) but use 
different professional, curriculum-aligned wording for each statement.

The variant should sound natural and professional for UK school reports.
Maintain the same pedagogical level and tone.
